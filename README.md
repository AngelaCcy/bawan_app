# BAWAN ‚Äì Beauty Product Buying Agency Web App

**BAWAN** is a full-stack web application built for a Taiwanese beauty product buying agency. It allows users to browse and purchase authentic skincare, makeup, haircare, and fragrance items, while admins can manage product listings with ease. The system features, layout, and color theme were all tailored in collaboration with the client to reflect a minimalist Korean-style aesthetic.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This project is still in progress. Some features, such as the admin dashboard, are under development.
